# Frontend Of Our Project

For security reasons we cannot open source our project. But for frontend we created a new laravel application so that you can contribute in the frontend. If we decide to use the theme/layout you created/contributed we will replace the current frontend to your version of the frontend. We will setup the controllers and other kinds of data issues for you and you only need to follow some steps to setup the codebase. The steps of setting up the codebase will be published soon.

## Steps To Set Everything Up

Once we published the codebase (Published) you can clone the git repo to your computer and start modifying the code. If you want to change the theme (Which shold be the main reason that you are contributing) you can locate in to REPO_LOCATION/client/resources/views/ for external css you can check out the tutorials in this page.

Make sure you have:
- Php 8
- Composer

ready for usage. We prefer [xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) for php installation. You dont need MySQL for developing in frontend but once we open source all parts of Congreer make sure you have MySQL installed.

# Tutorials To Begin Developing

If you don't know using laravel please first learn how to use laravel. Since this application has a authentication and more systems at our privet project, you just need to create layouts and templates. Now lets learn how to use our laravel project:

### Blade files, Routes And Controllers

This topic is really basic. You just need to read carefully. As you know in laravel the views are located under <i> resources/views/ </i> we use the same file locations as laravel. So you can write your views under <i> resources/views/ </i>. Routes are the same as laravel too. <i> routes/ </i> is where our routes. Controllers are in there normal location as well. They are located in <i> app/Http/Controllers/ </i>. Now we understand where our folders/files are in.

### Varibles And Custom Varibles

Since this project is just the frontend, we use static varibles for data. You can add more if you need to. Some examples are in HomeController.php located under controllers directory
<div style="background:green;">df</div>
